In November of 2021 Andreas Kling asked if he could interview me for [his youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling). 
He has a [very entertaining series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMOpZvQB55bdDy0Lgn9fG2c7NEK_rkkkQ)
where he interviews developers who contribute to the SerenityOS project. 

It was wonderful talking with Andreas, I really enjoyed the experience.
SerenityOS has been a significant part of my life over the past few years,
so it was nice to let the community know a little bit more about me.
