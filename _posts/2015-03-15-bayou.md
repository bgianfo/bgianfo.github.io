*Description From the video:*

> Peter Bailis presents the "Managing Update Conflicts in Bayou, A Weakly Connected Replicated Storage System" paper by Doug Terry, Marvin Theimer, Karin Petersen, Alan J. Demers, Mike J. Spreitzer, and Carl H. Hauser in SOSP 1995.

Peter does wonderful job summarizing the paper, and discussing the design implications of the project in relation to modern day systems.
You can find the original paper [here](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/bayou-sosp1995.pdf).
