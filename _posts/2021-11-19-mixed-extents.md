Back in September of 2021 I was invited to talk about SQLPAL on the SQL Server
podcast [Mixed Extents](https://eightkb.online/mixedextents/). The Mixed Extents
folks were a lot of fun to chat with. It's always awesome getting to talk to a
group of passionate and informed power users of SQL Server On Linux!
