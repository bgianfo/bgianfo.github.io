**Agustin Berg√©** wrote up a great summary of the changes 2015 brought to the C++ language, and what might be coming in C++17.
The post is available [**here**][interlude], it's well worth the read.

### Just A Quick Aside: ###
Looking at the [list][cpp2015] of papers from the C++ Standards Committee in 2015,
one of the recent entries [P0155R0][p0155r0] - "Handling Disappointment in C++", peeked my interest a bit.
During the past few years I've always been very interested in error handling techniques besides the standard return status code, or exception based solutions. In Handling Disappointment in C++ Lawrence Crowl
compares two proposals [N4109][n4109] - Addition of the Expected Monad and [N4233][n4233] - A Class for Status and Optional Value.

I need to take some time and play with the [Expected\<T\>][ex-t] style error handling and see how well it would fair in production code. Maybe in a future post?
