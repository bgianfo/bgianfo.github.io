### Many Code Review Systems

I'm a heavy believe in the value of [code review][cr]. I spend a large portion
of my days reviewing code from my peers at my day job. At Microsoft the universal
tool for code review is [CodeFlow][cf], a UI for reviewing code. It does a great
job for showing you all of the details of a singular code review. [Azure DevOps][ado],
[GitHub][gh], GitLab all have a way of viewing assigned reviews for given project.
Many developers today participate in projects across many different services,
some are involved in several internal projects during their work week and then
participate in or lead multiple several open source projects in their free time.

This whole system ends up being a bit of a time suck. All of these various platforms
rely on you to check them constantly to monitor progress on code reviews you are
the author of, as well as reviews where you are are a reviewer. This made me
wonder if it would be possible to create a grand, unified view of the status of
all your required work.

### Jane Street's "Iron"

Years ago I ran across the series of of talks and blogs that the folks over at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com)
put together about their internal code review system "iron".

- [Code Review that isn't boring](https://blog.janestreet.com/code-review-that-isnt-boring/)
- [Scrutinize your code in style](https://blog.janestreet.com/scrutinizing-your-code-in-style/)
- [Iron out your release process](https://blog.janestreet.com/ironing-out-your-release-process/)
- [Putting the I back in IDE: Towards a Github Explorer](https://blog.janestreet.com/putting-the-i-back-in-ide-towards-a-github-explorer/)

There are a ton of interesting things about the system they describe, one of the
most interesting to me was how iron gives you a singular UI to manage all review
activities from. For instance their is a global overview of all the reviews you
are an author of, and those you are a reviewer of. The overview gives you an idea
of how many lines are changed per review as well, this allows you to quickly unblock
your peer by choosing to review their small pull requests before working on your
own work.

### Introducing pr-dash

Late last year I finally had enough of trying to manually tracking pull requests
in all of these services. The faint memory of the iron overview user interface
lead me to create my tool for managing my pull requests. I ended writing [pr-dash][pr],
a console based pull request dashboard. It's currently written in C#, and lives
on github, it's currently implementation only has the ability to monitor Azure
DevOps repositories, but it was built with extensibility in mind. Extended it to
other services should be relative straight forward.
