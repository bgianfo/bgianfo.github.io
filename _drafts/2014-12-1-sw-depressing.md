Recently I was watching a recording of Stephen Kell's talk at strange loop this year, titled ["Liberating the Smalltalk lurking in C and Unix"](lib-sml) (video available [here](lib-sml-vid)).
The talk was great, I recommend taking some time out to sit down to watch it.


As I listened to the speaker, a very dark sadness came over me.
This wasn't a new feeling, just something which kind of awoke. 
A feeling that has been lying dormant in me for a long while.

I was saddened because of this repeated realization that the software is truly a depressing effort.
The pure futility of it is amazing to be honest, humanity is so driven to separate them selves and their works from others.
So keen on being different that we continually diverge, often for very menial reasons, even in software.

It doesn't matter if it's at the hardware level, the operating system level, the language level, or the library level, or even the application level.
We duplicate, and re-build everything, constantly. At points it's borderline sickening.
