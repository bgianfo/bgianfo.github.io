Recently I was watching a recording of Stephen Kell's talk at strange loop this year, titled
["Liberating the Smalltalk lurking in C and Unix"](lib-sml) (video available [here](lib-sml-vid)).
The talk was great, I recommend taking some time out to sit down to watch it.


As I listened to the speaker discuss the many interoperability problems between languages,
a feeling  which had been lying dormant in me for a long while surfaced once again.

It was a very deep, and very dark sadness. 

The sadness drew not from anything the speaker said, but from a renewed realization that the
path chosen by the software industry is truly a pathetic, futile, depressing effort.

To be honest the pure futility of it all is amazing.
Humanity is so driven to separate ourselves and our work from others.
We are so keen on being different that we continually diverge, unwavering often for very menial reasons, even in software.

The amount of duplicated effort between the millions of software project in existence has to be astronomically. 

It doesn't matter if it's at the hardware, operating system, language, library, or even the application level.
We duplicate, re-build, and regress everything. Constantly.

TODO: Examples - linux distros, languages, bsd variants.
